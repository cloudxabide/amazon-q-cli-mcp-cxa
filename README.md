# Amazon Q Developer + CLI + MCP - cloudXabide
Exploring Amazon Q and CLI with MCP


This repo should essentially be a "zero to hero" account of onboarding with Amazon Q CLI and using MCP servers to help create some code.

I first explored [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) which was cool and I wanted to, instead, use similar tools from Amazon Web Services.

Assumptions/Prerequisites:
I will provide guidance for the prereqs in the [references doc](./references.md)

* a decent understanding of AWS and managing resources via the CLI
* some understanding of the concept of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and why they are used.  
* AWS account with appropriate access/privileges


## Getting started
Install uvx via pip/pip3  (the Amazon MCP I am using will utilize uvx)  
Install node via brew (need for nvx for the Kubernetes troubleshooting stuff)  
Install Amazon Q CLI  
Configure your MCP for Amazon Q  
Have fun


## Summary
Have fun.  This is pretty amazing and cool stuff.
